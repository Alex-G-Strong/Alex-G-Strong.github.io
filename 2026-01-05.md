As it turns out, I could have camped here:

I almost certainly was trespassing, and camping illegally where I stayed last night, and was right(ish) to be in edge. 


I'm pretty lonely today. 

Saw 2 bike packing groups, both headed south. 
The first was a woman called Gretchen from fungaday, and the other kiwi called mo from Wellington. Gretchen gave me her number and invited me to stay with her and her husband if need be. 
I have another contact in fungaday so I suspect I will not need her, but it is good to have as a backup. 

The other was a German couple headed south, then up north on the west side. Both were very nice, and I was happy to run across them.
