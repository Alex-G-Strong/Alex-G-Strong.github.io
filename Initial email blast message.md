## Official version:

Howdy!

As you may know, I am headed to New Zealand for 11 weeks of bikepacking today (in fact, I am curly on a 16 hour flight to Christchurch, where I will start!). I'm calling the adventure "The Big Walkabout".

As part of the Walkabout, I have a blog where I intend to post semi-regularly, my thoughts, observations, gear rants, notes, and memories from the trail.

The site is up now, live, and has a post or two for reading already on it. Find it here:

Roughly the intention is to go first north, then south, always mostly by bicycle. Ultimately, however, the plan is to have no plan, and let the wind carry me where it wants me to go.

I would love to have you along for the ride.

Thanks!
Alex Strong.
