## On gear and the right kind of preparation

How prepared are you for every eventuality? What you bring, and the amount of it is an implicit answer to a fundamentally statistical question - what do you expect the variance of your environment to be, and what is the risk of not being able to cope with that variance. 

Risk, is worth talking about here too. Risk is consequence by[^1] likelihood. This is an idea I first heard from NOLS. In the demonstration, they show a 2x2 grid with increasing consequence on one axis, and increasing likelihood on the other. The highest risk square, the one where consequences are highest and likelihood is highest as well, is colored red. Adjacent squares, where EITHER consequence or likelihood are high, are colored yellow, and the remaining square, where likelihood is low and consequence is high is colored green. The chart provides a basis for decision making (especially decision making language), and helps clarify the fundamental concept of what a "risky" decision actually is. In a group setting, this is very valuable.

Thus, to know what to pack, you need to understand the distribution of uncertainty in your environment - the likelihood - AND the potential results created by the extreme outcomes - the consequence. By and large, the uncertainty factor is much harder to determine than the consequence factor. 

Nor is it true that any of these quantities are linear. How much clothing do you need when it's 100 out? Maybe short sleeves only[^3] What about 90? What about 60? 
In general, you start to know this only after you have gone for a bit. This is why you start so heavily laden. You don't know. 



, to understand what you are up against you need a few things. 


### on the day

What a day! 

Hands are burned, and I think my face too. Not enough sun screen. Turns out the sun here is a bitch, and it's summer - a gold old fashioned 1 - 2 punch, right to my own knuckles. 

I didn't get as far today as I thought I might (though, I can't say I was thinking I would go very far today at all). The segment I am riding is 189kms, and I went about 85kms. There is the whole new-to-new-zealand thing, and the real fact that 85kms (51 miles) is actually low key a long way, especially with a ton of gear. 

But I think I am having some pretty serious doubts about this whole doing-it-alone thing. And there are definitely fairly hard moments. In many ways, that was exactly what I wanted when I set myself to do it. 

It's as if I have jumped, and had the thrill of the free fall, but the water on entering is VERY cold. Quite a bit colder that I was expecting it to be, it turns out. I guess I am in the hyperventilation stage of the trip (at least that is my hope) and also the acclimation-to-the-cold part, where my skin temperature is rapidly falling to meet the water temp, growing me a thermal shell in the process. 

I started to run out of water around km 60, which was before the big climb. By km 75, I drank the remaining 0.5 L of my bottle. Km 85 was going to be my best bet for finding water - the route crosses a river there. Upon arrival, I saw it was fenced off. To get the water, or to wait another 10kms and suffer another relatively large climb to go to another river crossing with potentially the same situation, or go for it. 
I went for it. Two sheep watched me the whole time[^2].

In Texas this is a seriously-pretty-much-no-go situation (technical term). Absolutely do not continue beyond the fence line or you risk (only slightly hyperbolically) serious injury or death. The minimum is nothing (the land owner doesn't know your there) or its a stern conversation with a land owner, who will probably warm and let you stay anyway.

I assume it is something similar in New Zealand, but a person earlier let me know a few things:


I decided not to push it, and camp in the same spot I got water. 

The sheep were the most upset by this. A few bleated at me, I imagine, because I had pulled up in their spot. 

I think though, I am basically cooked. I am so tired from the past lot bit, that, even though 50 for the whole day does not see sufficient to me, I'll let it go. 
Isn't that part of the goal?


### Daylight's effects

presently I am 43°S, which is about the latitude of Eugene OR. The sun sets here at 21:15. Depending on the location of the valleys, shadows may crawl earlier (and given that the southern alps cast a shadow from the west as the sun sets, this is quite likely).







## Footnotes:

[^1]: I really wish English had better casual words for working with numbers. 'By', in this case is meant to be multiplied - as in an area 6 by 2. But the colloquial version of the phrase also confuses division - 6 by 2 is 3. I wish there was a better way to make the distinction. 

[^2]: What they say about NZ as a place with more sheep than people is almost certainly true in my limited experience. There are A LOT of sheep in this country. There are also a lot of cows. Of course, as my mind wandered on the trail, for every person in the US, there are probably like 10,000 individual maize plants, but it's not like the US is covered in corn (at least most places), so I suspect something similar in NZ - there are a TON of sheep, on the east side of the South Island.

[^3]: /begin rant: I STRONGLY disagree with the idea of wearing short sleeves on a very sunny day. Two reasons: skin cancer and skin again risks (balanced against vitamin d generation), and actually keeping cool. To hit the first, I am too pale to get away with skipping the sunscreen. In fact, I am of the opinion that the best sunscreen is the one you can see when it's applied, which is a long sleeve shirt with a hood along with a pair sun gloves. Look down and I can CLEARLY see whether I can see skin or not. As for being cooler, in my experience, especially in the drier Western US, the radiation of the sun heats you WAY more than the conduction from the environment. Instead, I suspect people get hot because they are not drinking enough water (which should be made such that it replenish the ions you are loosing). If you can't sweat, you can't cool off. In fact, I notice that once I start sweating, I appreciate the shirt for keeping me from getting too cold too fast when a breeze returns. /rant over!
