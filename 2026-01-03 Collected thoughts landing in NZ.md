A growing sense of excitement 

Dan millman - excitement is anxiety when you remember to breathe

A sense of forboding - no plan really does mean you'll have to figure it out.

I have lodging tonight, but there are some big huge question marks about what happens next. This was part of the fun when initially planning the trip - I would, after all was said and done, figure it out. 
I think this is where having someone to travel with would be nice. Someone to share your worries with. Someone to bounce an idea off of. Someone to prevent you from being split from the heard. 
And I guess that is also the drawback. The heard provides safety, but also a momentum that you must push against. Much like the wind, when it is with you, it is a breeze, when it's against you, it's just a slog. If course, there is a lot more you can do to set up the right kind of group than you can do with the wind. 

So why, exactly, did I go alone?
Right now, it feels like a bad idea.

Remembering with a touch of dread that I have chili flakes. Declaration of those.

It is just enough uncertainty to be anxious. Just enough to worry what could happen. 

Risk is consequence x likelihood. The worst that happens is not too bad, and the likelihood is not high. But the pit is still there. 

I am a huge plant guy. Generally I know at least the major ecosystems and species of the place I am going. I may not know all the plants, but I can recognize a few familiar faces.
I was curious about getting a guide to the plants of New Zealand, and in my research came across a startling fact:


> 80% of the flora in New Zealand is endemic.


That's a lot of percent. Another way to say this is to say that I will only could possibly know at first blush only as many as 20% of the plants I come across. I certainly do not know that 20% well enough to identify more than probably 1% or less - that is not a lot of percent.

I will be happy to know even a single plant when I look around.

Aeteroa. What a place.

I am here. It is real.

I suspect I may be taking a lot of photos.
